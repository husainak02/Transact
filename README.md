# Transact

## A tracker for your financial dynamics

This application is developed to provide an easy way of keeping track of your daily monetary transactions and exchanges.
It also offers the option to build your own profile and enter individuals to keep track of money you might have lent or 
borrowed from them, along with other additional features. The application also records the transactions you might make 
in your day-to-day life and offer a report of your financial activities such as your comparative spending and saving in 
a specified amount of time.

The application holds utility for anyone who wishes to keep a systematic record of their transactions. Furthermore, the
application is useful in keeping track of the money someone might owe you or vice versa. I personally chose this project
since for me, it will serve as an incentive to adhere to a fixed financial practice with a goal to save a particular
amount based on my monthly earnings. Additionally, sharing a living space with other people requires sharing of
resources that might involve daily lending and owing, and an application to keep track of those exchanges is preferable
than scribbling poorly recorded details in my notes.

Some key functions that the application will offer are:

- Add and record any financial exchanges with an individual
- Get details about and settle the financial exchanges with a specified individual
- Option to enter or delete your own daily transactions
- Set a financial goal to save a specified sum depending on your income
